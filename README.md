# City-Development-Simulator
A new city is being developed on an island and you are hired to help with the city planning! Your computer science skills are needed to develop a program to represent the potential layout of the new city and determine which buildings can be constructed and which locations are valid for those buildings. Use a 2D array to represent the city layout and insert the various Building objects into the corresponding cells of the array where the building is being added, but only if the proposed location is a valid place for it!
